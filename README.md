# Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to train a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of the movie review. 


### Dataset
To train the sentiment analysis ML model, I use the [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) from Stanford AI Lab. The training set consists of 25,000 highly polarized movie reviews, which has 12,500 positive reviews and 12,500 negative reviews. After training the model, it is evaluated on the testing set, which also has 12,500 positive reviews and 12,500 negative reviews

### Technologies
